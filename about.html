<h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">About Us</h2>

<body style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 16px">
  <br>
  <p>We met at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's Outreach Summer camp (SAILORS) in the summer of 2015. We were among 24 lucky rising sophomore girls to be immersed in a rich environment with professors and students from the AI department. A part of the Computer Vision section, led by Serena Yeung and Alex Alahi, we used computer vision and machine learning to develop an algorithm that would monitor hand sanitization in hospitals. The two week camp sparked our interest in the field, and we were fascinated by the real-world applications and impact of CV, so we really wanted to delve more deeply into computer vision. Serena kindly put together a mini class for us during the following school year. After we went through a more detailed course on computer vision, Stanford's CS131, and also wrote some programs, we put together what we learned into this website, hoping that others can also be inspired and can learn about computer vision.</p>
  <p>We want to thank everyone in the AI lab, especially Serena, for spending their precious time teaching and helping us. Serena, we are so grateful to have you as our mentor and role model. We appreciate all the time you put into this, meeting with us, guiding us through the lectures, and sending us feedback so that we could learn more about computer vision; your help has been invaluable.</p>
