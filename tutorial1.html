<h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">Tutorial 1: Pixels and Filters (Photo Processing)</h2>

<body style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 16px">

  <p style="font-weight: 500">Images as Functions</p>
  <p>We can think of an image, which is comprised of individual pixels, as a function, <i>f</i>. Each pixel also has its own value. For a grayscale image, each pixel would have an intensity between 0 and 255, with 0 being black and 255 being white. <i>f(x,y)</i> would then give the intensity of the image at <i>(x,y)</i>, assuming it is defined over a rectangle, with a finite range: <i>f: [a,b]</i> x <i>[c,d]</i> &#8594; [0, 255].</p>
  <p>[insert example]</p>

  <p>Simply put, a color image is just three functions merged into one. Using an RGB image as an example, the colors are constructed from a combination of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). The three colors have integer values from 0 to 255, yielding a total of 256*256*256 = 16,777,216 color choices. Each pixel of the image would therefore have three channels and be represented as a 1x3 matrix.</p>
  <p>[insert example]</p>

  <p>An image, then, can be represented as a matrix of pixel values.</p>
  <p>[insert example]</p>

  <p style="font-weight: 500">Image Processing</p>
  <p>There are two sides to image processing: image filtering and image warping. Image filtering changes the range of an image. Image warping changes the domain of an image.</p>
  <p>[insert graphs/pictures]</p>

  <p>We will examine more closely image filtering. The goal of using filters is to extract valuable information from the pictures such as edges, corners, and blobs (See Tutorial 2 to learn more about finding features.) and/or to modify or enhance image properties. Here are some examples of what applying filters can do to make images more visually appealing.</p>
  <p>[insert example]</p>

  <p>Two commonly implemented filters are the moving average filter and image segmentation.</p>
  <p>The moving average filter replaces each pixel with the average pixel value of it and its adjacent pixels. The effect is a more smooth image with sharp features removed.</p>
  <p>[insert gif]</p>

  <p>Image segmentation extracts certain parts of an image based on a threshold. In this example, all pixels with an intensity greater than 100 are replaced with a white pixel (intensity 255) and all others are replaced with a black pixel (intensity 0).</p>
