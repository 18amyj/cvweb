<h1>Introduction to Computer Vision</h1>

<h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
<p>Computer vision is the science of teaching a computer how to interpret images.

This is exactly what researchers aimed to do starting in the 1950s. They began to gain deeper understandings of the inner workings of the human eye.</p>
