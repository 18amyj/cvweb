<h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">What is computer vision?</h2>

<body style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 300; font-size: 16px">

<p>Computer vision is the science of teaching a computer how to perceive, process, and interpret visual data such as images and videos.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 400">The goal of computer vision is to bridge the gap between pixels and meaning.</p>
<img src = "#">
<p>However, before computers could emulate visual perception in humans and be able to &quot;see,&quot; researchers had to explore and unravel the inner workings of the human eye. Their findings would set the stage for groundbreaking discoveries in computer vision.</p>

		  <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">MIT Summer Vision Project</h2>
          <n></n>
          <p>Ironically, computer vision was first introduced as an MIT summer project. The summer workers had to work efficiently to &quot;participate in the construction of a system complex enough to be a real landmark in the development of &quot;pattern recognition&quot&quot. 50 years later, today, scientists are still trying to fully understand pattern recognition and computer vision.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">Hubel and Wiesel</h2>
          <n></n>
          <p>Hubel and Wiesel significantly advanced the understanding of sensory processing. They were able to show that the visual stimuli travels towards the visual cortex in the brain and the signals then branch out to ocular dominance columns. Each individual cell is responsible for a particular detail of the image. The information is then passed to other parts of the brain to stimulate other detectors in the brain. This discovery was the basis for neural network concept that researchers mainly use today.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">Irving Biederman and Molly Potter</h2>
          <n></n>
          <p>In the 1970s, vision scientist Irving Biederman and cognitive scientist Molly Potter both discovered how efficiently humans are able to recognize and interpret what they see.</p>
          <p>Biederman also proposed the Recognition-By-Components (RBC) theory, which suggests that humans are able to recognize objects by splitting them into their main component parts, called geons. He would go on to study face recognition as well and argue that it is a process distinct from the recognition of objects.</p>
          <p>Potter determined whether or not a sequence of pictures, displayed at rates approximate to those of eye fixations, are understood and then forgotten.</p>
          
          <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">Simon Thorpe</h2>
          <n></n>
          <p>Simon Thorpe authored the Speed of processing in the human visual system. Like Biederman and Potter, he also noted how humans can instantaneously recognize well known or commonly seen objects and scenes. He set out to determine exactly how “instantaneous” human eye processing is by using event-related potentials (ERPs), or measured brain activity in response to a certain stimuli, which reveal signs of neural processing well before a physical response is elicited.</p>
          <p>Thorpe devised a go/no-go categorization task, where subjects decided whether a photograph, flashed for 20 milliseconds, contained an animal. Results showed that frontal negativity for no-go trials developed roughly 150 milliseconds after the image was displayed.</p>
          <p>Thorpe concluded that visual processing can be reached in under 150 milliseconds.</p>

          <h2 style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: 400">Change Blindness</h2>
          <n></n>
          <p>Change blindness is a phenomenon in visual perception in which very large changes occurring in full view in a visual scene are not noticed (O'Regan, 2001).</p>
          <p>Originally, it was proposed that the changes were not noticed because they happened during eye movements. The retinal image shifts as a result of eye movements, and the brain stabilizes the view. It was thought that this brain mechanism is imperfect and unable to account for all the differences in what is seen.</p>
          <p>However, this theory was disproved in 1997 by Rensink, et al. when they used what is called the flicker technique. When a blank screen was displayed between the initial picture and modified picture, it was harder for the subjects to locate the change as opposed to if there were no flicker.</p>

          <img src="http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/ECS/kayakflick.gif"/>

          <p>Simons, et al. conducted more studies based on this finding and experimented not only with flickers but also with different types of disruptions. They used global disruptions, local disruptions, and slow changes.</p>
